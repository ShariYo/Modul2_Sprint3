Parametric approach:
- The potential disadvantage of a parametric approach is that the model we choose
will usually not match the true unknown form of f.
- If the chosen model is too far from the true f, then our estimate will be poor.

Non-parametric approach:
- since they do not reduce the problem of estimating f to a
small number of parameters, a very large number of observations (far more
than is typically needed for a parametric approach) is required in order to
obtain an accurate estimate for f.


Simple random samples (SRS):
- When fitting models to data from SRS (Simple random samples), select distributions
for variables with important property that all observations in data are indepenent.

Clustered samples:
- These arise from study designs that generate clusters of related observations.
- Because observations from same naturally occurring cluster will tend to be similar
to each other, need to account for this correlation when fitting model to data.

Longitudinal data:
- Repeated measures of same variable, collected from same unit over time (likely correlated).
- Recorded observations on variable of interest no longer completely independedt of each other.
- Models fit to repeatedly-measured variables need to account for within-unit correlation.

Two main objectives of Model Fitting:
1) Making inference about relationships between variables in a given data set.
2) Making predictions/forecasting future outcomes, based on models estimated using historical data.

statsmodels.stats.descriptivestats.describe(df["column"]) - gives statistics like pandas about data
OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) - for linear models
GLM (Generalized Linear Models) - for nonlinear mean structures and non-constant variance.
GEE (Generalize Estimated Equations) - for linear models but the new way, when the data are non-independent.
MIXEDLM (Multilevel Models)

F-statistic: overall significance of the model

prob F-statistic: p-value associated with the F-statistic

R-squared: proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables in the linear regression

p-value: measures statistical significance of the experiment

constant coef: it is INTERCEPT and represents the expecetd mean value of the dependent variable when all predictors are zero

standard error: measures the average distance that the observed values fall from the regression line

t-value: used to test the hypothesis that a coefficient is different from zero.
